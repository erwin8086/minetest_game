V DONE!
X on ice for now

Basic rules:
* Light == power
  N: we need a list of all nodes that gives light...
  N: maybe use luacmd?

* Vitamins
* Things that logically use electric power shold use it.
* Things that can go off shold got off
  most food, iron tools
* Things that shold require steel shold use carboon steel instead of iron
* Plastic shold require LV machines
* Things that logically require plastic shold use plastic

To add:
* a new lv distribution system for short distances (16 blocks)
  without physical wires
* a fridge to cool things (maybe)
* more bronze (maybe)
    * Aluminium bronze
    * Leadbronze
    * Silicium bronze

misc:
v Oilextract from leaves trowght extraction
  V Parafin and lube from oilextract trowght extraction
	- I added a alternative (wastefull) approch to get plastic
	- Treetap recipe changed to not require pipes
	- Extractor requires pipes so you must craft the plastic using the treetap and torches...
	- Treetap can get oil extract from leaves 1/5 (chance)
	- Treetap uses bowl from xdecor

  * Recepies with lube...
  X Plastic from Parafin with compressor (maybe we need the extractor first, check for craftableity without plastic
OR: Add an mineraloil mod...

* (low priority) Alter the xdecor workbench, so it craft other things using the Hammer

TODO:

V Craftguide for treetap
V Paraffin craft not shown...
