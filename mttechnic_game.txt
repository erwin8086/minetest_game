* TODO
v partial done
V DONE!
X on ice for now

Basic rules:
* Light == power
  N: we need a list of all nodes that gives light...
  N: maybe use luacmd?
  - What about decorative only things -> we cannot cut power because the only deco
  - so it does not matter if the connected or not?

* Vitamins
  - exist such a mod or need it to be written?

* Things that logically use electric power shold use it.
v Things that can go off shold got off
  V most food
  * iron tools
  - Item spoil patial done, need to add inv's and food's to the list -> done for now
  - To add an food item simply add 'spoil = <days>' to the def
  - To add an inv simply add spoil to depends.txt and call 'spoil.register_inv(<nodename>, {<list1>, ... })'

* Things that shold require steel shold use carboon steel instead of iron
  - new iron tools -> steel_tools = carbon_steel != iron
  - tool levels = ... -> bronze -> iron -> steel -> ...
  - iron shold require good fuel -> coal or charcoal

V Plastic shold require LV machines -> Added alternative wastefull recipe for the start...
* Things that logically require plastic shold use plastic

To add:
* a new lv distribution system for short distances (16 blocks)
  without physical wires
* a fridge to cool things (maybe)
* more bronze (maybe)
    * Aluminium bronze
    * Leadbronze
    * Silicium bronze

misc:
v Oilextract from leaves trowght extraction
  V Parafin and lube from oilextract trowght extraction
	- I added a alternative (wastefull) approch to get plastic
	- Treetap recipe changed to not require pipes
	- Extractor requires pipes so you must craft the plastic using the treetap and torches...
	- Treetap can get oil extract from leaves 1/5 (chance)
	- Treetap uses bowl from xdecor

  * Recepies with lube...
  X Plastic from Parafin with compressor (maybe we need the extractor first, check for craftableity without plastic
OR: Add an mineraloil mod...

* (low priority) Alter the xdecor workbench, so it craft other things using the Hammer
* (low priority) Food in the Oven/Microwave and Ores in the furnace/el. furnace

* (medium priority) check mtfood recipes for comaptiblity -> Only one milk, sugar, etc item in game

* Only wood, stone and iron can be repaired in the Workbench

* Add mods: nixie_tubes, travelnet(shold require power), luacmd(maybe add some other things for testing...), digtron(shold use battery insted of coal?), doc+doc_minetest_game(maybe add some more doc's for other things)
* Add more food mods and make them compatible -> spoil...

V circular saw produce the same items as the workbench(and more)
  - The gamestage is workbench -> circular saw(requires iron)
* Check the CNC machine for redunance/usefullness -> Maybe change something

* Give the Toaster, coffemaker(we have alredy coffe) some function
* Non technic recipes shold use metal plates too...
* Add more awards...
